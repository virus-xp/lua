-- The print statement is used to display the output on the console. In this case, the output is "Hello World!" and "This is Chapter 1 of Lua Language Programming". The print statement is a built-in function in Lua that is used to display text on the console. The text to be displayed is enclosed in double quotes. The print statement can also be used to display variables and expressions. The print statement is a very useful tool for debugging and testing code. It is often used to display the output of a program to the user. The print statement is a simple and effective way to communicate with the user and display information on the console. It is a very useful tool for programmers and developers. The print statement is a basic feature of the Lua programming language and is used in many different applications. It is a very versatile tool that can be used in a wide variety of situations. The print statement is a very powerful tool that can be used to display information on the console.

-- Variables and Data Types

-- In Lua, variables are dynamically typed, meaning their type is determined at runtime.
-- Here are some examples of different data types in Lua:

-- Number: Lua has a single number type, which is a double-precision floating-point.
local numberVar = 10.5
print("Number: ", numberVar)

-- String: Strings are sequences of characters.
local stringVar = "Hello, Lua!"
print("String: ", stringVar)

-- Boolean: Booleans can be either true or false.
local booleanVar = true
print("Boolean: ", booleanVar)

-- Table: Tables are the only data structure in Lua and can be used as arrays, dictionaries, etc.
local tableVar = {1, 2, 3, key = "value"}
print("Table: ", tableVar[1], tableVar[2], tableVar[3], tableVar.key)

-- Nil: Nil is a type with a single value, nil, which represents the absence of a value.
local nilVar = nil
print("Nil: ", nilVar)

-- Function: Functions are first-class values in Lua.
local functionVar = function() return "I am a function" end
print("Function: ", functionVar())

-- Demonstrating dynamic typing
local dynamicVar = 42
print("Dynamic typing - Number: ", dynamicVar)
dynamicVar = "Now I'm a string"
print("Dynamic typing - String: ", dynamicVar)
